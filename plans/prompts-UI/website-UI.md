## Feature: Website creation
Create a consolidated insurance advisor exprience with mock data. The experience includes the following core components:
- register and login
- Profile management
- Preference management 
- unified case & policy management dashboard that tracks the application throughout the process and enables advisors to view the book of business.
- self service options like address change, beneficiary changes, etc.
- commission dashboard that enable advsisors to track their historical and current compensation.

Use prudential.com theme for this experience. No backend server needed for this mock. Plan is to add it later. You can use the context of life insurance advisor. 

## Feature: Copilot addition.
Your goal is to create a chatbot copilot experience. You can draw inspiration from Microsoft apps where the copilot UI slides from the right side of the screen. User should be able to drag and size the copilot UI. The icon for copilot should sit next to the bell/ notifications icon on the screen.

Functionality wise, the copilot should allow users to query product information in english language. You can use mock data for this. Use prudential.com color scheme. Tell me your plan.


## Feature: Global search bar addition.
Your objective is to create a global app search option. This can be added as a search icon on the right top next to the notification option. 

Behavior: When use clicks on the search icon, it pops up a modal with placeholder text "Search Advisor Portal". This is not a typeahead search. Post user is done writing text and pressing enter, it brings up a page that shows the search result. Ensure that the search results look and feel modern and good. 

Asthetically, the search bar modal should cover most of the web page.  

Guardrails: You are allowed to use your life insurance knowledge to create mock content. Do not write code yet. When its time to code, kill existing runs if any and run the code with hot reloads. Create a plan of action.

### Enhancement: Modernize search bar.
Your objective is to make the search bar feel more modern with the content that you already have on the screen. Ensure that the search across types "clients", "policies", etc. fit in a single line. The search bar itself is too boxy - make it look like openAI search bar or similar. I like the layout of the search results page. 

Guardrails: You are allowed to use your life insurance knowledge to create mock content. Do not write code yet. When its time to code, kill existing runs if any and run the code with hot reloads. Create a plan of action.

## Feature: Site navigation
Objective: make the side nav bar on the left side collapsible. When collapsed, the "Advisor Portal" title should be reflected in the then header.
