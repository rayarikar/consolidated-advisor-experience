## Feature: Adding preferences to the profile page.
Objective: You are craeting life insurance agent preferences to the profile page. The preferences allow the advisors to get communication preferences.

Use the openAPI spec from the advisor-preferences-backend directory to model your preferences experience. The spec itself is what the backend preferences API has to offer.

Guardrails: You are allowed to use your life insurance knowledge to create mock content. Do not write code yet. When its time to code, kill existing runs if any and run the code with hot reloads. Create a plan of action.
