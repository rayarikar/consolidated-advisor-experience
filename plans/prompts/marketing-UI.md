Feature: The marketing page is not formatted well. The cards should be of equal shape and size for both forms and products.

Use your knowledge of life insurance and come up with a few overlapping and few different riders per product. Mock data is good. When the user searches for a product, only the riders for that product should show up in addition to the product information. Similarly, when the user searches for a rider, only the products for that rider should show up in addition to the rider information.
